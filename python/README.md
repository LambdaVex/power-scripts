Run Python scripts
------------------
```bash
# use python or python3

$ python
>>> from yourScript import yourMethod
>>> yourMethod()

#or

$ python3 yourScript.py
```

PEP 8 tells you that:
------------------
* modules (filenames) should have short, all-lowercase names, and they can contain underscores.
* packages (directories) should have short, all-lowercase names, preferably without underscores.
* classes should use the CapWords convention.
